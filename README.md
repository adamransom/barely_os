# Barely OS

The goal of this project is to eventually write an extremely simple kernel for the Raspberry Pi 3, in order to learn more about bare-metal programming and how operating systems work in general.

At first, this will mostly be experiments with bare-metal programming in assembly, then transitioning into Rust and finally starting to work towards building a kernel.

I hope to record at least some of this journey on my blog over at [adamransom.github.io](https://adamransom.github.io), though I can't vouch that'll be updated all that frequently.

## Setup

In order to run these examples, you will most notably need a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. Whilst a lot of the same code can be used on a Raspberry Pi 2, there are some big differences early on (for example when trying to turn on the ACT LED).

Secondly you will need the [arm-none-eabi](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download) toolchain to assemble, link and generate a binary image to put on your SD card.

Finally you will need [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) if you want to make building the examples easier.

## Usage

If you have `make` installed, all you need to do is run:

```Bash
make
```

Then you will need to copy the generated `kernel.img` to your SD card, along with the [Raspberry Pi boot files](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot) (`bootcode.bin` and `start.elf`), put the card carefully in your Pi and you are good to go!

## What does it do?

Well, right now the small assembly file simply turns on the activity LED on the Raspberry Pi 3. Hopefully a lot more interesting things will happen soon!
