@; This turns on the ACT LED for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B v1.2
@;
@; The ACT LED is no longer wired directly to a GPIO pin and now belongs on
@; the GPIO expander, which is controlled by the GPU. In order to communicate
@; with the GPIO expander, we need to use the GPU's mailbox interface (in
@; particular, we need to send a message to the property tag channel).
@;
@; Property tag channel: 8
@; Property tag ID: 0x00038041 (SET_GPIO_STATE)
@; Property tag message: 130 1 (ACT_LED pin number followed by state)
@;
