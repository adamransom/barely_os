//! Defines functionality for the mailbox system of the BCM2837.
//!
//! There is some documentation regarding the use of the mailbox on the [Raspberry Pi Wiki] which
//! defines most of the implementation used in this module.
//!
//! # Notes
//!
//! A lot of implementations seem to check the wrong status registers when reading and writing.
//! This usually does not matter though, as in normal use the mailboxes will rarely become full.
//! However, [testing has shown][2] that it is correct to read mailbox 1's status when writing and
//! mailbox 2's status when reading.
